          <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
            Have you discussed your decision with your manager or HR to explore
            possible alternatives?
          </Typography>
          <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
            Ensure you’ve completed any pending tasks or projects to facilitate
            a smooth transition.
          </Typography>
          <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
            Make sure you’ve reviewed your benefits, including unused leave,
            final paycheck, and health coverage.
          </Typography>
          <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
            After submission, HR will guide you through the exit process,
            including paperwork and final meetings.
